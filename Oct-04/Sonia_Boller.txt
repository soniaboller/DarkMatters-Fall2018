** Browne says “epidermalization here is the imposition of race on the body.” How is race imposed on individuals by how are they seen in society?

** How can the surveillance of blackness help us understand the social conditions of surveillance more generally?

** How do new technologies change the invasiveness and effectiveness of surveillance, or what Gary T. Marx calls “the new surveillance”?

** What are some real life examples of different forms of veillance described by Steve Mann, such as counterveillance, sousveillance or univeillance?


This is truthfully a medium-drunk stream of thoughts about the reading but also about surveillance as it exists currently: 

Reading this text pretty immediately made me think about the surveillance systems set in place in China, and how that more or less embodies the dystopic view of what surveillance can embody and in my mind how easily it can be manipulated. 

The most recent article I read was about a woman that was accepting of the fact that every aspect of her life was monitored and that every action that she took was factored into her scoring on some "acceptable human" rating system. Some of the surveillance factors were buying diapers (indicated parenthood (++)), buying alcohol (--), indicated lack of sobriety and dependance on substance). 

Some of the aspects of being an "acceptable human", or I guess to her since she was striving to be an "extraordinary human" (gaining as many social points as possible), were qualities of obeying rules and being diligent and being complicit – following some arbitrary guidelines that dictate what humanity should be like.

I was biking to class the other day, and realized that if my every movement was tracked, I  probably would have racked up over a thousand dollars in red light bike tickets.

Reflecting on that independent of this reading, and then reading this reading, really struck a chord in me regarding how much surveillance is subjective. Because I'm a relatively non-threatening biker (half asian half white woman) that runs red lights because I treat them as stop signs, it is 100% acceptable for me to break rules. If I were black, or what has been prescribed as a threatening race/ethnicity, then none of those free passes would have been granted. The statistic about SEVEN times more black men being incarcerated vs white men being incarcerated for the same crime or legal transgression is such an obscenely offensive statistic that makes it pretty impossible to deny the influence of skin color and cultural background in regards to incarceration and detrimental surveillance. 

"Dark Matters" really emphasized the role that surveillance has in our lives, and while some of it seems mundane, it all still monitors and collects data on every aspect of our waking life, which when manipulated or utilized in cunning ways, undermines the actual data and can be used to convey whatever message one is trying to convey.

All data can be manipulated to support an argument.
